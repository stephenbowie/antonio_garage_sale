### notes from the author

 - the app is designed to do the following : 
    •  Initially, the first 20 products should be loaded, then once the user has scrolled down to the end of the list
        the next 20 are loaded and so on until all products are loaded
    • User should be able to filter the list by different product categories
    • User should be able to search products via free text field
 - fetches data from https://dummyjson.com/docs/products
 - uses latest version of react
 - uses semantic ui (for self learning purposes)
 - used https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component?activeTab=readme because i used it before in a project and we have tested this(works really well) and implementation is elegant and simple (see in the comments in the productview if we have to reuse the component)
 - not typescript (not yet needed for the purpose of this project now)
